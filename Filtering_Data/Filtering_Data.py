Regular expressions, to test the code:
1.  Test case: listing all lines where a colon (":") is not immediately preceded by a word.
    Regular expression: (?<!\w):

2.  Test case: stripping all comment lines from a Python program.
    Regular expression: ^\s*#.*$

3.  Test case: listing all lines where one or both of the words "Latitude" and "Longitude" are missing.
    Regular expression: ^(?!.*\bLatitude\b)(?!.*\bLongitude\b).*$

4.  Test case: showing the section headers in an HTML-file, supposing each section header occupies one line; section headers are surrounded by tags "<h#>" and "</h#>" with "#" a number 1â€“6
    Regular expression: ^<h[1-6]>.*<\/h[1-6]>$
